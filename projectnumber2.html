      <p>Fountain at Mira Hills
        Just nearby the Pagburnayan are the Mira Hills. This place is also known as the Filipino-Spanish Friendship Park. This is a popular place for outings and picnics. The place is not that big, but there are a lot of trees that provide a nice shade. There are several fountains in the area. It also happens to have a water reservoir that provides water to the residents.
        Tank to Store Water
        Among the places we’ve visited in Vigan so far, this seems to be quite a big letdown. There really isn’t anything much to see here. Other than to just sit around an quietly let the day pass. The place is a nice place for meditation and relaxation, though with the popularity of this place is suppose this would be next to impossible to do on weekends.</p>

            <li><p> honor this Spanish conquistador, a monument was erected in the city square, surrounded by all the important edifices of the town. From Plaza Salcedo, one can see and walk leisurely to not only the Saint Paul Cathedral but the Arzobispado or Archbishop’s Palace, the Vigan City Hall and the Ilocos Sur Capitol as well. All were seats of power over life and death in the olden times, and now places of tourist interest, too. In Salcedo Plaza, visitors will find the Salcedo Obelisk which was placed in the elevated plaza during the 17th century as the plaza’s centerpiece. It is literally the focal point of the city’s Spanish urban design.</p></li>

                <li><p>Vigan has produced a lot of the country’s heroes who came from various fields. Father Burgos is the only one from the clergy. He fought for ecclesiastical reforms to ease the inequality suffered by Filipino priests during his time. He was executed in Manila’s Bagumbayan together with two other clergy reformists. They are collectively known in Philippine history as the Gomburza, which stands for their surnames Gomez, Burgos and Zamora. Visitors can learn more about this scholar-priest when they visit his monument in Plaza Burgos.</p></li>

            <ul><h1>Pakbet</h1>
              <li><p>Pakbet or more known as Pinakbet for people in the South, is also one of Ilocos’s preserved dishes. Vigan’s style of pakbet sets its difference from the Southern’s through adding bitter gourd and excluding squash which is a key ingredient of Southerns. Ilocanos customarily uses vegetables which can be grown from their backyards such as eggplants, okra, string beans, chili peppers, and bitter gourd. If you’re feeling a bit conscious about your health, this is the perfect meal to try out in Vigan.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <img src="royal bibingka.jpg">
            <ul><h1>Royal Bibingka</h1>
            <li><p>A sweet tooth must-try, the royal bibingka also made its mark as one of Vigan’s specialties. If compared with the ordinary “Christmas bibingka”, Vigan’s royal bibingka falls short if size were the basis. But, what they say is true, small is terrible. In this case, terribly delicious! The crusty top and the sticky but soft cupcaked-sized body makes up the crowd favorite bibingka. Topped with cheese and butter, you can never go wrong with a Royal Bibingka.</p></li></ul>

              <img src="longganisa.jpg">
            <ul><h1>Longganisang Iloko</h1>
            <li><p>If you’re a breakfast geek, Longganisang Iloko which is also branded as Vigan Longganisa among locals is the town’s own traditional version of a sausage. A bit plump, full of garlic, and seen as a bit yellowish compared to usual sausages but one small bite can change your life. Filipinos cook them in a pan with a bit of water. After the water evaporates, the longganisa is fried using its own fat and is further fried until it turns slightly brown. It brings out its best flavor when dipped in vinegar.</p></li></ul>
            
            <img src="empanada.jpg" >
            <ul><h1>Empanada</h1>
            <li><p>Of course, if you’re in town, you shouldn’t miss out on this one. Found almost anywhere within the crowded plazas of Vigan, Empanada is something Vigan takes pride in. Combining the aforementioned Longganisang Iloko, beans, shredded cabbages, grated unripe papayas, onion, garlic and egg makes up the core of orange-colored Empanada. Sellers make it right before your very eyes which is also another interesting sight.</p></li></ul>

            <img src="bagnet.jpg">
            <ul><h1>Bagnet</h1>
            <ul><li><p>Traditionally dried under the sun, marinated then deep-fried to make it crisp and tender, Bagnet is recognized as the region’s delicacy symbol. This huge chunk of meat with crunchy golden skin that was fried to perfection can be eaten at any time of the day which is convenient for travelers as it is available basically everywhere. One bite and you’ll get hooked so be wary of this cholesterol-rich slice of heaven.</p></li></ul>
